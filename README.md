# How to run

If you just want to see the app, an already running web instance is available here: https://beansa.hesoyam.ee/

## To run locally in the web browser

- You have to have Flutter and Dart installed on your machine. Those should be of appropriate versions (versions listed above.)
- Inside the project folder, exectue `flutter pub get` command.
- The repository includes no builds. So you would have to either build the app, or run a test instance.
  - To simply run a debug instance in the browser without explicitly building, execute `flutter run --release` inside the project folder and choose the desired target platform (for the web, choose one of the available browsers). The browser should open by itself after compilation completes.
  - For building the release for the web, please refer to the following manual: https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/web#building-the-app-for-release

Note: if you are getting errors while trying to run, most probably the project is not compatible with your version of Flutter.
