# Devtailor Flutter task

**This is a 1-view "sign up form" Flutter task for  at Devtailor.**

Author: Richardas Ker≈°is

The project was built with Flutter version 3.0.5 and Dart version 2.17.6

# How to run

If you just want to see the app, an already running web instance is available here: https://beansa.hesoyam.ee/

## To run locally in the web browser

- You have to have Flutter and Dart installed on your machine.
- Inside the project folder, run `flutter pub get`.
- The repository includes no builds. So you would have to either build the app, or run a test instance.
  - To simply run in the browser without separately building, execute `flutter run` inside the project folder and choose the target platform (choose one of the available browsers).
  - For building the release app for the web, refer to the following manual: https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/web#building-the-app-for-release
